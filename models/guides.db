It's a foundational movement in strength training, and an exercise EVERYBODY should be doing regularly. However, it's also an exercise that about 95%25 of people get wrong and do incorrectly. Here's how to get into proper push-up position:</p><ol class=%22wellbeing-body%22><li>On the ground, set your hands at a distance that is slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. </li><li>To alleviate wrist pain (if you have poor wrist flexibility) do your push-ups holding onto push-up handles or a bar</li><li>Your feet should be set up in a way that feels right and comfortable and in balance.</li><li>Think of your body as one giant straight line from the top of your head down through your heels. Your butt shouldn't be sticking way up in the air or sagging.</li><li>If you have a problem getting the proper form with your body, try this: clench your butt, and then tighten your abs as if you're bracing to get punched.</li><li>Your head should be looking slightly ahead of you, not straight down.</li><li>At the top of your push-up, your arms should be straight and supporting your weight.</li><li>Nearly EVERYBODY does push-ups with their arms out far too wide and their shoulders flared. If I was looking down at you from above, your arms and body should form an ARROW, not a T.</li></ol>"}
